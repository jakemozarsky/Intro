      Ohio State might have lost "The Game" to rival Michigan, but since, the Buckeyes have been unstoppable. This once again was the case Friday night in Dallas, where they <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/recap?gameId=401677191">defeated Texas 28-14</a> in the Cotton Bowl.

      Concerns surrounded Ohio State entering the College Football Playoff after a 13-10 loss to the Wolverines that saw them miss out on the Big Ten Championship. The No. 1 Buckeyes have went on a dominating run in the postseason, beating No. 9 Tennessee 42-17, No. 1 Oregon 41-21 and now defeating the No. 5 Longhorns.

        The Buckeye defense, who entered the game No. 1 in yards per game and points per game allowed, stopped Texas on a goal line stand with two minutes remaining. On fourth down, senior defensive end Jack Sawyer sacked Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers and returned it 83 yards for a touchdown, icing the game.

       With the win, Ohio State advances to its first National Championship since 2021 looking to win their first title since 2014. The Buckeyes face No. 7 Notre Dame in Atlanta on January 20.
